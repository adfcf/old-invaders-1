# old-invaders-1
## What is it?
It's a very simple Java game I made when I was younger. I've lost the source code, so I had to decompile the executable. The game is but a bunch of rectangles, but unlike [old-plataforms](https://github.com/adfcf/old-plataforms), the player (a blue rectangle) has to avoid and destroy red rectangles by shooting projectiles at them. 

## Important
- This is a decompiled version which was uploaded here almost exactly as it was produced. Thus, it contains strange formatting and structures.
- The code itself also contains peculiar design decisions, but do remember this is very old and I was very young at the time.
